title: ! '''lvalue'' considered harmful'

<p>If there is one term I would like to erase from computing terminology
forever, it is &lsquo;lvalue&rsquo;. It is a confusing and distracting term, and
far from making a discussion more precise, it makes it less so.</p>

<p>The problem is that there are multiple competing definitions for lvalue.</p>

<h2>1. A storage location: The C Standard definition</h2>

<p>A C <em>lvalue</em> is an expression which refers to a location which can
store a value.</p>

<p>This is the definition I am most familiar with. Given the C code:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="predefined-type">int</span> a[<span class="integer">30</span>];
<span class="predefined-type">int</span> i=<span class="integer">3</span>,j=<span class="integer">5</span>,k=<span class="integer">10</span>;
a[i] = k;</pre></div>
</div>


<p>the following are <em>all</em> lvalues:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>a
i
j
k
a[i]
a[j]
a[k]</pre></div>
</div>


<p>because every one of these expressions refers to a memory location
which holds a value. The standard suggests in a footnote that it is
helpful to think of &ldquo;lvalue&rdquo; as short for <em>locator value</em>.</p>

<h2>2. Something which can be assigned to: The C Standard &ldquo;modifiable lvalue&rdquo;</h2>

<p>In C, a <em>modifiable lvalue</em> is an expression which <em>may</em> appear on the
left-hand side of an assignment.</p>

<p>Note that this is not contingent on there being such an assignment;
only that assignment is <em>possible</em>. As a result, given the same C
example code, the following are modifiable lvalues:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>i
j
k
a[i]
a[j]
a[k]</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Notably missing is a. a is an lvalue but not a modifiable lvalue,
because it refers to a location in memory but can not appear as the
left side of an assignment. In C, you cannot assign to a whole array,
only to one cell at a time.</p>

<p>In contexts outside of C, this is often simply referred to as an
lvalue, but when talking about C you should stick to Standard
terminology to be as precise as possible. Especially if you&rsquo;re asking
questions on comp.lang.c.</p>

<h2>3. Something on the left of an assignment: the &ldquo;left-hand side&rdquo; definition</h2>

<p>This definition is of a totally different character to the C Standard
definitions. In the perl code:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>my $array = [];
my $i = 3;
my $j = 5;
$array-&gt;[$i] = $j++;</pre></div>
</div>


<p>this definition states that the <em>only</em> lvalue is $array->[$i] because
it&rsquo;s on the left-hand side. $array->[$i] is an lvalue <em>only</em> in the
context of this assignment; in another assignment (say, $foo = $bar)
$array->[$i] is no longer an lvalue, $foo is instead.</p>

<p>There is an obvious problem in this example that $array->[$i] is not the
only expression which gets written to: $j is also written to by the
autoincrement operator.</p>

<p>I believe when people use this definition, they really mean definitions 4 or 2
but are using sloppy language. Nevertheless it is a definition which
people use.</p>

<h2>4. Something which is written to</h2>

<p>This is similar to the above argument, but states more precisely that
an lvalue is something which is written to in an expression. In the
above example, there are two lvalues: $array->[$i] and $j, both of which
are written to as a result of the code. I like it more than definition 3 for
this reason, but you can start to see how thinking of &lsquo;lvalue&rsquo; and
&lsquo;rvalue&rsquo; as analogous to &lsquo;left&rsquo; and &lsquo;right&rsquo; breaks down.</p>

<h2>Mutual incompatibility</h2>

<p>These four definitions are mutually incompatible. The biggest problem
is that definitions #1 and #2 are absolute, while #3 and #4 are
contingent on a particular assignment. Under #3 and #4, a variable can
be an lvalue in one line of code, but on the next line it is not an
lvalue because it is not written to. Under #1, a variable is <em>always</em>
an lvalue because it always refers to a location in memory. Under #2,
a variable is <em>always</em> an lvalue unless it is of some type unsuitable
for assignment &mdash; a constant, for example.</p>

<p>In other words, definition #2 says an lvalue <em>can</em> appear on the
left-hand side of an assignment, while definition #3 says an lvalue
<em>does</em> appear on the left-hand side of an assignment.</p>

<p>Definitions #1 and #2 are incompatible in programming languages which
have storage locations which cannot be assigned to. Such a location is
a #1-lvalue but not a #2-lvalue. The chief problem requiring separate
definitions in C is the existence of array and structure types &mdash;
these cannot be directly assigned to. In modern programming languages,
arrays and structures can typically be assigned, so this problem is
moot.</p>

<p>The other main type of location which cannot be assigned to is a
variable with constant type. There are many languages in which you can
declare variables constant. A reasonable modification can be made to
definition 2 to say &ldquo;an lvalue is an expression which could be on the left-hand
side of an assignment, ignoring constant qualifiers&rdquo;; but then there
exist lvalues which cannot be assigned to. Nevertheless outside of the
context of C there are situations in which it is reasonable to
conflate #1 and #2.</p>

<h2>A survey of definitions</h2>

<p>I did a search of various programming resources I know for definitions
of lvalue. Here is what I came up with:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.itu.dk/courses/BPRD/E2009/fundamental-1967.pdf">Strachey&rsquo;s seminal
paper</a> in
which he coins the term L-value: &ldquo;An L-value represents an area of the
store of the computer.&rdquo; pretty explicitly #1</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lvalue">Wikipedia</a>: &ldquo;A value (computer
science) that has an address&rdquo; #1 as of time of writing</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lvalue">Wiktionary</a>: &ldquo;A value that
can be treated as an address  or storage location.&rdquo; #1 as of time of
writing.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/208808373">Computer Programming and Precise
Terminology</a>, a Dr Dobbs
article: #1</li>
<li>C Standard (read a <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf">free draft
here</a>): #1
(and #2 for modifiable lvalue).</li>
<li><a href="http://foldoc.org/lvalue">Foldoc</a>: &ldquo;A reference to a location, an
expression which can appear as the destination of an assignment
operator indicating where a value should be stored.&rdquo; #1 and #2 in the
same sentence.</li>

<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f90831hc.aspx">msdn</a>: &ldquo;An
lvalue refers to an object that persists beyond a single expression.

</ul>


<p>I must be honest here and say I fully expected more instances of
definitions #3 and #4 than I found. I have come across people using #3
and #4 on mailing lists and in fora enough for the term to be a source
of confusion &mdash; in fact, just today I saw somebody using definition
4. The mnemonic value of &lsquo;lvalue&rsquo; and &lsquo;rvalue&rsquo; versus &lsquo;left&rsquo; and
&lsquo;right&rsquo; encourages people to think of lvalues as something to do with
assignment, rather than as something to do with persistent storage
locations.</p>

<p>In any case, in my experience there are enough people confusing the
term &lsquo;lvalue&rsquo; that I feel that it should not be used at all. I would
instead recommend the term &lsquo;location&rsquo;. If you must use the term
lvalue, please use definition #1.</p>

<h2>On rvalues</h2>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t mentioned the term rvalue at all here. It doesn&rsquo;t get used
nearly as much, for which I am thankful; I believe the reason it isn&rsquo;t
used is because the term <em>value</em> does the same job much better, or
where more precision is required, <em>value of an expression</em>.</p>
