<p>Sadly I wasn&rsquo;t able to attend this month&rsquo;s dojo; but Robert Chatley has done a <a href="http://chatley.com/posts/10-28-2011/overtone/">great writeup</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks also to <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/">Mark Needham</a> for stepping in at the last minute as a replacement ThoughtWorks representative at the dojo!</p>
