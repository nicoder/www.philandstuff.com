title: London Clojure Dojo, September 2011

<p>The latest clojure dojo was on a subject suggested by <a href="http://rrees.wordpress.com/">Robert
Rees</a>: write a program to play 20
Questions, such that the program starts with a small dataset of known
celebrities, but each time it fails to guess someone, you teach it a
new question. So, for example, if it had guessed Barack Obama but I
was thinking of Abraham Lincoln, I could teach it to ask &ldquo;Are you
alive?&rdquo; to distinguish between these two people later.</p>

<p>I decided to take the idea and extend it by writing a shared server
which everyone could use. They would download the initial dataset,
play a game locally, then when they were finished, upload their
dataset back to the server to share with everyone else.</p>

<p>The code for the server is on <a href="https://github.com/ppotter/questions-server">my
github</a>. It operates via
simple HTTP &mdash; there is one URL at /20-questions/latest which accepts
either a GET request to pull down the data, or a PUT to push it back
up.</p>

<p>Once again, I learned a number of lessons &mdash; last time, they were
about participating in a dojo, this time, they were about organizing a
dojo.</p>

<h1>Lesson 1: User input is hard.</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s upsetting that I hadn&rsquo;t thought about this beforehand, but just
like in every other language, user input in Clojure is painful, and
difficult to get anything done with in the time constraints of a dojo.
Although one or two of the dojo teams managed to wrestle with
read-line enough to get it working, the rest of the teams ended up
writing internal DSLs (or, less grandiosely, functions) to play the
game without having to solve some accidental complexity. In hindsight,
I might have thought more deeply about how to deal with user input.</p>

<h1>Lesson 2: Error handling feedback is important</h1>

<p>A number of the teams had problems uploading to the server. Uploading
is always going to be harder than downloading, because you have to
generate the data in the correct format, and there&rsquo;s more ways for
that to go wrong than for parsing the downloaded data.</p>

<p>The server had actually been set up to issue useful responses to
problems: if it thought a request was not well formatted, or that it
didn&rsquo;t resemble a tree of questions, it would return a 400 (Bad
request) code. If, on the other hand, it received a valid question
tree, but one which was based on out of date data, it would return a
409 (Conflict) response. An example of the latter situation is where
you try to upload a tree, but somebody else adds a new celebrity and
beats you to it. In order to prevent people from wiping out each
other&rsquo;s progress, the server would reject the request and issue a 409.</p>

<p>Two problems prevented this from being useful feedback. The first was
that I just didn&rsquo;t explain this at all; I felt that it might be too
much detail to go in before people had gotten their teeth into it. But
I could have at least mentioned that the error codes were meaningful
and that they could have asked me for help once they had reached the
point of trying to upload.</p>

<p>The second problem was that clj-http, the library we were using, did
not show very much feedback when the error responses were received.
The server had, in fact, filled in a full request body, explaining the
situation in plain english; but clj-http just threw an exception which
said &ldquo;400&rdquo; or &ldquo;409&rdquo; &ndash; not even a &ldquo;Bad request&rdquo; or &ldquo;Conflict&rdquo;! This
made the fact that there was more information available very
undiscoverable.</p>

<p>So all in all, as I could see these problems happening, people
struggling with user input or seemingly random HTTP response codes, I
was getting more and more nervous that nobody would be able to upload
anything to the central server &mdash; whose data, by the way, was being
projected onto a big screen for everyone to see. Thankfully, after a
while, one of the teams successfully uploaded, and shortly thereafter,
a number of the other teams did too. By the time we were ready for
show and tell, we had built up quite a question tree:</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ve never seen such a great example of the GIGO principle.</p>

<p>If you want to see some of the client code, <a href="https://github.com/tuor713/20-questions">team
4</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NeillAlexander/london-clojure-dojo-20-questions-group-5">team
5</a>
uploaded theirs. Also, after the dojo, Uday created a <a href="https://github.com/uday-rayala/20QuestionsClient">zipper-based
client</a>.</p>

<p><em>The London clojure dojo happens on the last Tuesday of every month.
During the dojo, we split into groups of four or five around a single
computer, and each person takes a turn at the keyboard. This ensures
that even if you have zero clojure experience, you will get the
opportunity to write some code at the event.</em></p>

<p><em>Entry to the dojo is free, but advance booking is required. Listen
for announcements on the London clojurians mailing list.</em></p>
