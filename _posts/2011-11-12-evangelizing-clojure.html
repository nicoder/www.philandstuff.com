title: Evangelizing Clojure
published: true

<p>I&rsquo;m currently attending the second annual
<a href="http://clojure-conj.org/">Clojure Conj</a>, the premiere
Clojure-specific conference. One of the themes that has been emerging
is evangelizing Clojure: getting more people to use it, and convincing
people to use Clojure who otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t choose to use it.</p>

<p>This was in fact the central theme of
<a href="http://www.nealford.com/">Neal Ford</a>&rsquo;s talk &ldquo;Neal&rsquo;s Master Plan for
Clojure Enterprise Mindshare Domination&rdquo;, in which he put forward his
ideas for how to get large organizations full of institutional inertia
to adopt Clojure. Phil Bagwell also made reference to this in the
introduction to his talk, in which he asked everyone using Clojure in
their day job to put their hand up, then asked everyone who&rsquo;s never
deployed Clojure to production to put their hand up, then asked group
2 to talk to the nearest person in group 1 and ask them how they got
to work in Clojure.</p>

<p>Clojure evangelism has also been a common theme of Q&amp;A sessions after
talks: a talk on ClojureScript will often be followed with a question
such as &ldquo;How do you fit this into an existing JavaScript project?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are a few key themes emerging:</p>

<h2>Know your enemy</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of competition amongst the new language communities,
particularly between Scala, Clojure, and Groovy. This is absolutely
fine and as it should be. Furthermore, if Scala is successful, this is
<em>in no way</em> directly detrimental to Clojure.</p>

<p>Scala, Clojure and Groovy are in competition, but they are not enemies
of each other. The real enemy is the <strong>status quo</strong>. It is the nasty
feeling that people have when they say things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Taking on Clojure is a big risk &ndash; I want to be certain&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I think Clojure might be a better choice than Java, but because
Java is an industry standard, I am more likely to get blamed if I
choose Clojure and the project fails.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;If I choose Clojure, I don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;ll be able to hire developers
who know it&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>Ultimately, these statements reflect a sentiment that staying with the
same old technology is safer than trying to improve productivity by
choosing a newer, but less well-known, technology.</p>

<p>If a client has switched from Java to Groovy, Scala, or JRuby, they
have <em>already rejected the status quo</em>. Encouraging an environment in
which people feel able to explore new technologies will make more
people who are interested in Clojure overcome their fears and try it
out. In other words, a rising tide raises all ships.</p>

<h2>Be positive about the new possibilities, not negative about the status quo</h2>

<p>By and large the feeling of the conference has been upbeat and
positive, rather than tribal. That is why, when a couple of
off-hand jokes about Ruby were made, people immediately
<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/gga/status/135025877552599040">called it out</a>
as nonconstructive.</p>

<p>Clojure and Scala in particular are languages which make many things
possible which simply aren&rsquo;t possible in other languages. This can
lead to a feeling of superiority. <em>Fight that feeling!</em> Clojure is not
going to gain mindshare by denigrating Ruby and Java; it is going to
gain mindshare by promoting itself and solving problems
effectively.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there are many problem domains where the existing tools
are entirely appropriate &mdash; Rails is a fine framework, and although it
has limitations, those limitations don&rsquo;t manifest in most
use cases. Even some of the clojure.core team use Rails for most of
their work, and Clojure only for the difficult problems. Denigrating
Rails builds walls, when we want to be building bridges.</p>

<h2>Build grassroots through the back door</h2>

<p>Many recent successes in language proliferation have been achieved
simply by providing great tools in those languages. Even if someone
doesn&rsquo;t particularly want Ruby, they might well want Cucumber. If they
don&rsquo;t want Groovy, they might still want Gradle.</p>

<p>On my current project, we&rsquo;re using <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> for a
test stub, even though none of us is a particular JavaScript
advocate. Node was just the best tool for the job, so we used it. But
that&rsquo;s caused a lot of us to look at JavaScript in a new way, and I&rsquo;d
say we&rsquo;re all more likely to use JavaScript again in future as a
result.</p>

<p>This is a great way to build up mindshare. I think one tool I&rsquo;ve
learned about at the conj which could fill this role is
<a href="https://github.com/heroku/pulse">pulse</a> from Heroku, described in
<a href="http://markmcgranaghan.com/">Mark McGranaghan</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Logs as Data&rdquo;
talk. Pulse is a tool for processing logs not as a stream of bytes but
as a stream of events and rich data objects. Another is
<a href="https://github.com/nathanmarz/cascalog">Cascalog</a>, from Nathan Marz
at Twitter, which is a high-level abstraction over Hadoop MapReduce,
which creates a very nice internal DSL for modelling MapReduce
computations as queries and predicates.</p>

<h2>In summary</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a really exciting conference for me, because Clojure is both
a great language, and at a key point in its history. It has reached
maturity, it is being used by a few people in production to solve
interesting and difficult problems; but the next step is to evangelize
Clojure, to get it used in earnest by more and more people.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>
