<p>Some very common phrases you hear in political debate is "so-and-so is <br />very right wing" or "he's a socialist" or "she's all about big <br />government". You also get refinements to the left/right divide, from <br />"far left" (communist party), "left" (old labour), "left of centre" <br />(lib dems), "right of centre" (new labour), "right" (conservatives), <br />"far right" (bnp). But what does it all mean? Are they useful labels, <br />and do they form a coherent continuous line from far left to far <br />right? <p /> Here are some policies I associate with "left": big government, higher <br />taxes, equality, government provided services (education, health, <br />social security, pensions), regulated markets, redistribution of <br />wealth, an "equal society", relaxed attitude to immigration, relaxed <br />attitude to the EU, <p /> And some I associate with "right": small government, lower taxes, <br />individual freedom, privately chosen and paid-for services (education, <br />health, social security, pensions), free markets, wealth as an <br />incentive to betterment, the "American Dream", restrictions on <br />immigration and asylum claims, euroskepticism, <p /> When we use terms such as "left" or "right" we assume several things: <br />that somehow, these baskets of policies are associated with one <br />another; that left and right policies are diametrically opposed; and <br />that these policies are the only ones which matter. I don't believe <br />any of these to be the case. <p /> First, are these policies associated with each other? Well, I would <br />say tight immigration controls are diametrically opposed to free <br />markets. If Polish plumbers are prepared to work for less money than <br />their British counterparts, in a free market I should be able to <br />choose for myself which one I want to fix my bathroom. But immigration <br />controls remove that choice and mandate that I pay a British plumber, <br />by preventing the Polish plumber from entering the country. "British <br />jobs for British workers" also inevitably means "less choice for <br />British consumers". <p /> Are left and right policies diametrically opposed? If we look at free <br />markets versus regulated markets, while it initially sounds like they <br />are totally opposite, it is not as simple as that. A market cannot <br />exist without some rules: for example, without rules, why would I <br />trade with you when I can just steal from you? We need property laws <br />and regulations to punish those who break the rules. I want to employ <br />someone, but I want to know they are competent at mathematics -- we <br />need a system of regulations around qualifications to give me the <br />freedom to choose the candidate I want. Some types of market freedom <br />require regulation. <p /> And are these the only policies that matter? I haven't mentioned the <br />environment, Scottish independence, ID cards, policing, housing or <br />defense (including nuclear weapons), because I have no idea what the <br />generic "left" or "right" think about them. But they are important <br />policies. <p /> In the end, it's far better to choose the policies you care about the most and find the politicians who support those policies. <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/">TheyWorkForYou</a> doesn't try to work out whether each MP is "left" or "right", but instead tells you how each MP voted on a range of issues. See for example <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/malcolm_bruce/gordon#votingrecord">Malcolm Bruce (LD, Gordon)</a>, <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/edward_miliband/doncaster_north#votingrecord">Ed Miliband (Lab, Doncaster North)</a>, <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/eric_pickles/brentwood_and_ongar">Eric Pickles (Con, Brentwood &amp; Ongar)</a>. Once you've seen that, you might not be able to divide these three into simple positions on the left-right spectrum, but you cannot come to the oft-heard conclusion that "they're all the same". No, they're all different. With 650 MPs, you have 650 different opinions on the way the country should be run, and it would be optimistic to hope they all fit onto one line from "left" to "right".</p>
