title: ! 'Learning monads in Clojure: a warning'
published: true
---
<p>I was inspired to learn about monads by
<a href="http://literateprogrammer.blogspot.com/">Chris Ford</a> recently; his
description of encapsulating impurity safely within a pure language
had me intrigued immediately. I decided that I wanted to learn about
monads in Clojure, a language I am currently diving into.</p>

<p>However, I found learning about monads in Clojure full of
<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">fake difficulty</a>
(or accidental complexity, if you will). Here I document the issues I
found. And the key issue I came across was this:</p>

<h2>Learning monads requires reasoning about types</h2>

<p>You probably know where I&rsquo;m going with this. Clojure is dynamically
typed. Haskell, the spiritual home of monads, is statically
typed. For me, the key to understanding monads was reasoning about
types &mdash; in particular, drawing a clear distinction between the
ordinary type and the type of a monadic expression.</p>

<p>In drawing this distinction, it helped me reason about the behaviour
of the monadic functions. By learning that <code>m-bind</code> must return a
monadic expression and not a simple value, I learned a key fact about
monads; but the number of times I tried to write <code>m-bind</code> expressions
beforehand which did not return monadic expressions beforehand was too
many.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s quite possible to reason about types in a dynamically typed
language, but it&rsquo;s made much harder. If your reasoning is faulty, the
program will try to carry on regardless, and in Clojure&rsquo;s case, give
an incredibly cryptic error message. This is not an environment that
makes learning easy. If I had been learning in Haskell, my failure to
understand the distinction between monadic expression and ordinary
value would have immediately been set right by the type checker.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s worse than just making learning hard: Clojure&rsquo;s dynamic
typing has led to a pervasive failure of type reasoning.</p>

<p>A key example of this is that Clojure&rsquo;s implementation of the maybe
monad, <code>maybe-m</code>, breaks the monad laws! It does this because it does
not properly distinguish between the monadic expression and the
underlying type. The law in question is the first monad law, expressed
here as a Midje test:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="comment">;;; given a monad which defines m-bind and m-result,</span>
<span class="comment">;;;       f, an arbitrary function, and</span>
<span class="comment">;;;       val, an arbitrary value</span>
(fact <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">The first monad law</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>
    (m-bind (m-result <span class="keyword">val</span>) f)
    =&gt; (f <span class="keyword">val</span>))</pre></div>
</div>


<p>The failure of <code>maybe-m</code> to adhere to this law is demonstrated thus:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="comment">;;; failing midje test</span>
(fact <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">maybe-m should adhere to the first monad law</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>
    (with-monad maybe-m
        (m-bind (m-result <span class="predefined-constant">nil</span>) <span class="keyword">not</span>))
    =&gt; (<span class="keyword">not</span> <span class="predefined-constant">nil</span>))</pre></div>
</div>


<p>The reason that this law is violated is that the <code>maybe-m</code> monadic
expression type is no different from the underlying value type. It is
therefore possible to find a value such that <code>(m-result val)</code> is
<code>nil</code>, the maybe monad&rsquo;s value for failure.</p>

<p>The Haskell Maybe monad is not so sloppy:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>&gt; let myNot x = Just (x == Nothing)
&gt; (return Nothing :: Maybe (Maybe Char)) &gt;&gt;= myNot
Just True
&gt; myNot (Nothing :: Maybe (Maybe Char))
Just True</pre></div>
</div>


<p>This is because in Haskell, there is no value <code>foo</code> such that <code>Nothing
== return foo</code>; in Clojure, there is such a value: <code>(= nil (m-result
nil))</code>.</p>

<p>The repercussions of <code>maybe-m</code>&rsquo;s violation of the first monad law are
relatively minor: it means that when using <code>maybe-m</code>, the value <code>nil</code>
has been appropriated and given a new meaning; which means that if you
had any other meaning for it, you&rsquo;re stuffed.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you wanted to implement a distributed hash table
retrieval, where failure could be caused by a network outage. You want
a function behaviour similar to <code>(get {:a 1} :b)</code>, where if the value
is not in the table you return nil. If you use <code>maybe-m</code> to perform
this calculation, you cannot tell the difference between failing to
communicate with the DHT, and successfully determining that the DHT
does not contain anything under the key <code>:b</code>; both will result in the
value <code>nil</code>. Worse, if you want to use this value later in the
computation, the <code>maybe-m</code> will assume a value missing in the DHT to
be a failure, and cut your computation short &mdash; even if that&rsquo;s not
what you wanted.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>If you want to learn monads, do it in Haskell.</p>

<p>If you must do it in Clojure, the key is to understand and distinguish
the various types in play. The monadic type is distinct from the
underlying type. <code>m-result</code> takes an underlying value and gives you an
equivalent value in the monadic type. <code>m-bind</code> takes a monadic value,
and a function from an underlying value to a monadic value.</p>
