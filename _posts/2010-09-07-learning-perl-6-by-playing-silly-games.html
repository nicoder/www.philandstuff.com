title: Learning Perl 6 by playing silly games
published: true
---
<p>So I decided to take the plunge and see what Rakudo* has to offer and what
Perl 6 is like as a language. I&rsquo;ve always found the best way to learn
programming is through examples and by doing tasks, so when I found the
<a href="http://github.com/perl6/perl6-examples">perl6-examples</a> collection, I started
to go through the
<a href="http://github.com/perl6/perl6-examples/blob/master/99-problems/99-problems.pod">99-problems</a>
one by one.</p>

<p> Although I started out writing &ldquo;baby&rdquo; perl 6, I quickly found that
other people&rsquo;s solutions to the problems were shorter &ndash; <em>and</em> clearer
&ndash; than my own. It&rsquo;s quickly become clear that the menagerie of perl 6
operators is more expressive than I ever imagined possible. I&rsquo;ve never
complained that a language lacked a particular operator, or that a
language should be extended by adding more operators. Perl 6 may be
changing my mind.</p>

<p>Today all this was made clear by a silly example in #perl6: noughts
and crosses! (or tic-tac-toe, if you prefer.) The problem: given a
noughts-and-crosses grid, where the players are 1,-1 and the empty
squares 0, determine who, if anyone, has won. Here&rsquo;s the first example
that <a href="http://use.perl.org/~masak/">masak</a> made:</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/568359.js"></script></p>

<p>He uses a <code>slicel</code> function to create cross-cutting slices of
multidimensional arrays, and uses his list of lines to go through all
possibilities, finding a winner. He also takes advantage of the <code>[==]</code>
reduction metaoperator: <code>[==]</code> results in <code>a == b &amp;&amp; b == c</code>. The
reduction metaoperator can also create such useful functions as <code>[+]</code>
sum and <code>[*]</code> product, which in other languages would require a
separate function call. In Perl 5, for example, product is <code>reduce {
$a * $b }</code> using <code>reduce</code> from <code>List::Util</code>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my improvement:</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/568382.js"></script></p>

<p>By flattening the board array, I avoided the need for a <code>slicel</code>
function; I also used the <code>X+</code> cross metaoperator to shorten creating
the lines. <code>Xop &lt;1 2 3&gt;</code> gives <code>a op 1, a op 2, a op 3, b op 1, b op
2, b op 3, c op 1, c op 2, c op 3</code>. Then
<a href="http://perlgeek.de/en/">moritz_</a> pointed out that <code>0,1,2</code> can be
written using the upto operator: <code>^3</code>:</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/568390.js"></script></p>

<p>Further refinements are possible: <code>0,3,6</code> is <code>^3 »*» 3</code>, using the
hyper operator to multiply each of <code>0,1,2</code> by 3. But by this point,
we&rsquo;re just using different Perl 6 operators for the sake of it, not
because it makes the code clearer. Like code golf, this is hackers at
play; and while the product is not something necessarily useful, the
learning I&rsquo;ve gained from it is invaluable.</p>
