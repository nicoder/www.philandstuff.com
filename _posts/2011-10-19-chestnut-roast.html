<p>I recently found out that a vegetarian friend of mine had never heard of chestnut roast! Although I am a massive carnivore now, I was in fact a vegetarian for five years, and during this time I discovered that chestnut roast is possibly the best vegetarian dish there is. I mentioned it in passing to my fiancée, who immediately suggested that I could cook it for her. I should learn to keep my damn mouth shut.</p>

<h2>ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>240g chestnuts, in one of those weird vacuum-sealed tins</li>
<li>150g cashews</li>
<li>4 closed cup mushrooms</li>
<li>120g goat&rsquo;s cheese</li>
<li>sage</li>
<li>tarragon</li>
<li>parsley</li>
<li>2 slices granary bread, turned into crumbs</li>
<li>small amount of veg stock</li>
<li>2 onions</li>
<li>knob of butter</li>
</ul>


<h2>Method</h2>

<p>Heat the butter in a frying pan, then chop and fry the onions. After a while, chop and add the mushrooms.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, chop/bash/whizz the cashews. Add the chestnuts and whizz or mash.</p>

<p>When the onions and mushrooms are done, add to the nut mix and stir well. Add the goat&rsquo;s cheese, veg stock, chopped parsley, sage and tarragon, and breadcrumbs.</p>

<p>Roast in a pre-heated oven at 200 °C for an hour.</p>

<p>Serve with potatoes and veg. We had mash and peas.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>Delicious.</p>

<p>I think next time I&rsquo;d ditch the tarragon, as it tends to overpower the rest of the flavours. Also, I think I have too many things competing with the chestnuts &mdash; the mushrooms and breadcrumbs are probably diluting the flavour too much.  This is a delicious meal, and one I had for christmas dinner when I was a vegetarian. It takes a fair amount of prep work and a long cooking time, so it&rsquo;s not going to become a normal after-work evening meal for me, but I&rsquo;ll keep it in my repertoire for special occasions.</p>
