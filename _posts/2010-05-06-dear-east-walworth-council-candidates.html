None of you are trying hard enough. <p /> I tried to find out about you online, I tried to read your leaflets to <br />understand who *you* are, I tried to find out what you would do with <br />my council. But none of you seem to be trying to tell me. The only <br />person who has any real Google visibility is Kirsty McNeill, who is <br />moving on to better things as Gordon Brown's speechwriter. <p /> Your leaflets say nothing about local elections, only about the <br />Bermondsey and Old Southwark general election. <p /> As a result, only two candidates stand out for me. Martin Seaton, who <br />helped chair a meeting with developers when our local park was <br />threatened with being developed into flats, came across as a very good <br />facilitator and though he was a neutral chair at that meeting, he came <br />across as genuine and concerned. And Ben Johnson, who is the only <br />candidate I have spoken to during this entire process, gave me a call <br />and put up with my complaints about dishonest Lib Dem leaflets. As a <br />young and enthusiastic candidate, I feel he's a much better bet than <br />old and apathetic alternatives. <p /> The rest of you must try harder if you want to get my vote.
