So the lib dems have declared war on banker's bonuses [1]. <p /> I don't like banker's bonuses. They have two problems: 1) Someone is <br />getting paid lots of money to do something which can't be that hard, <br />and 2) Someone is incentivised to take more risks than is good for the <br />bank, since greater risk gives greater potential reward and greater <br />potential bonus. The solution to 1) is to get over it; it's the way <br />the world works, and bankers are hardly unique in this position <br />(footballers, opera singers, chief executives also spring to mind). <br />The solution to 2) is to have a system where the banks aren't <br />incentivising excessive risk-taking. <p /> Consider that I am a banker, with a bonus scheme where I am rewarded <br />more for earning more for the bank. Consider that in a given year, I <br />have a 1/4 chance of losing £1m and a 3/4 chance of making £1m for the <br />bank. If I am lucky and make the £1m, I get a bonus of £X; if I make a <br />loss for the bank, I get nothing. <p /> But suppose I also have the option to gear up my trading strategy by a <br />factor of 10. Then I have a 1/4 chance of a £10m loss and a 3/4 chance <br />of a £10m gain. If I have made £10m for the bank, I should be getting <br />quite a bit more than £X bonus, while if I make a £10m loss I can't <br />get a smaller bonus than zero, so I'm quids in either way. But the <br />bank is now running the very real risk of losing £10m on my trades. It <br />might have considered the £1m risk acceptable, but the £10m risk as <br />unacceptable, but the bonus structure does not reflect this fact at <br />all. <p /> This is what is meant when it is said that bonuses encourage excessive <br />risk-taking. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that there is so <br />much randomness involved -- if I might make a huge loss due to a <br />market crash beyond my control, I'm not going to be terribly motivated <br />to work hard on a marginally better strategy unless the potential <br />bonus is pretty huge [2] -- and in many cases, bankers' bonuses are as <br />big as or bigger than their salaries. <p /> What is the solution? Well, if you curtail banker's bonuses, the banks <br />will maintain remuneration packages by pushing salaries up instead. <br />And without bonuses, bankers have no incentive to take excessive risks <br />-- but they also have no great incentive to make money for the bank <br />either. If you made £10m for your employer, wouldn't you want a slice <br />of that pie? <p /> The lib dems' proposals just seem to be a grand "up yours" to the <br />bankers without actually trying to understand and solve the problems <br />represented here. <p /> [1]<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/2010/04/lib_dems_smaller_bonuses_small.html">http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/2010/04/lib_dems_smaller...</a> <br />[2]<a href="http://www.forbes.com/2006/05/20/executive-compensation-tournament_cx_th_06work_0523pay.html">http://www.forbes.com/2006/05/20/executive-compensation-tournament_cx_th_06wo...</a>
