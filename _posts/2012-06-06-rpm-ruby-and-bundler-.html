<p>I was on a project recently where we wanted to deploy a Ruby Sinatra
application to a CentOS 6.2 production environment. Our means of
distributing software to all our environments was RPM &ndash; we took our
sinatra app, packaged it into an RPM, and stuck it in
production. Installing all our software via RPM has certain
advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>On a production system, all installed files belong to some RPM. This
means that any given file in production can be traced, via the RPM
it belongs to, back to the Jenkins job which created it and the
source code version which defined it.</li>
<li>We were using puppet for configuration management, and puppet has
good support for installing RPM packages via the package resource
type. This resource type ensures idempotency and enables the ability
to roll versions of software forward or backward with confidence.</li>
</ul>


<p>Any nontrivial ruby application will want to depend on some gems, and
ours was no different. We used bundler to manage our gem
dependencies. This carries its own advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>We don&rsquo;t have to care about transitive dependencies. Bundler pulls
them in for us.</li>
<li>Conversely, we can lock the transitive dependencies we&rsquo;ve pulled in
using Gemfile.lock and by checking our gems into vendor/cache.</li>
<li>Our gems are isolated from those belonging to other applications, so
different apps can use different versions of the same gem in safety.</li>
<li>Bundler is quite capable of managing different sets of gems for
build, test, and deployment. This means we can also control which
version of rake, rspec, rack-test etc will be used to build and test
our application in CI.</li>
</ul>


<p>We were also following the advice of
<a href="http://ryan.mcgeary.org/2011/02/09/vendor-everything-still-applies/">vendor everything</a>
&mdash; we were running <code>bundle package</code> to download gem files to
vendor/cache and checking them into source control. This practice means:</p>

<ul>
<li>CI doesn&rsquo;t need to talk to rubygems.org to build our app. We have
faster and more reliable builds.</li>
<li>We are firmly locked to a particular set of gems. You might think
that Gemfile.lock does this, but you&rsquo;d be wrong. Gemfile.lock
doesn&rsquo;t by default carry specific versions of transitive
dependencies, only constrained versions. For example, we use the
passenger gem, which pulls in fastthread. Our Gemfile.lock has a
dependency on fastthread (>= 1.0.1), meaning that we don&rsquo;t know
specifically which version of fastthread will be used. By vendoring
everything, we know exactly which version of which gem is used by
any given version of our source code, because it is the version
saved in vendor/cache.</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p>However, we quickly hit a number of issues with bundler which made it
difficult to package up our RPM satisfactorily:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bundler wants to be run on the target machine at deployment time,
not on the CI server at build time</li>
<li>Bundler has lots of implicit configuration in .bundle/config and in
environment variables</li>
</ul>


<h2>RPM and Bundler&rsquo;s competing installation practices</h2>

<p>In order to get bundler to install the gems that we have previously
stored in the vendor/cache directory, we need to run <code>bundle install
--deployment</code>. The <code>--deployment</code> option combines all sorts of
desirable options for a production environment:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bundler normally installs gems to the system gem path. In deployment
mode, they are installed to vendor/bundle instead. This provides
isolation from gems used by other apps on the same machine.</li>
<li>Bundler normally will update Gemfile.lock if you have made changes
to your Gemfile. In deployment mode, this is considered an error, as
it indicates that the checked-in gems do not match those specified
in the Gemfile.</li>
</ul>


<p>A fundamental question we had was: at what point in the
build/test/deploy process should we run <code>bundle install --deployment</code>?
The bundler docs are pretty clear about this: all of the
<a href="http://gembundler.com/deploying.html">deployment examples</a> run
<code>bundle install</code> on the target machine; the
<a href="http://gembundler.com/bundle_install.html">bundle install</a> overview
page says of <code>--deployment</code>: &ldquo;Do <strong>not</strong> use this flag on a
development machine.&rdquo;, though it offers no reason why. (The man page
says: &ldquo;it will cause in an error when the Gemfile is modified&rdquo;, but it
doesn&rsquo;t say why <em>this</em> will happen. For that, see the next section.)</p>

<p>Conversely, the philosophy of RPM is pretty clear too: <code>bundle install
--deployment</code> should <em>not</em> be run on the target machine, because it
creates a vendor/bundle directory which does not belong to any
RPM. This means that when we uninstall or upgrade the RPM, the
vendor/bundle directory will be left behind, potentially poisoning the
bundle for future versions of the app. We could add a %preun script in
our RPM specfile to remove the bundle and the .bundle/config file, but
it&rsquo;s a hack. What we really want is to deploy our gems into their
final locations on the CI server, and package them up into an RPM.</p>

<p>It seems that bundler and RPM have competing design principles, so
they don&rsquo;t want to play nicely together.</p>

<h2>Bundler&rsquo;s implicit state</h2>

<p>Bundler also has a confusing habit of implicitly creating and storing
all sorts of state. There are two main culprits here: the
.bundle/config file, and environment variables.</p>

<p>The .bundler/config file, which lives in the same place as the
Gemfile, is the reason that you shouldn&rsquo;t run <code>bundle install
--deployment</code> on a development system. Bundler will save state to this
file about the installation that it has done: location of installed
gems, excluded groups, whether or not the gemfile is frozen, etc.</p>

<p>Bundler also sets up some environment variables which mean that
bundler is not reentrant. We came up against problems during our build
process, where within our Rakefile we had the line:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>bundle install \
  --path %{buildroot}/usr/lib/%{name}/vendor/bundle/ \
  --deployment \
  --binstubs %{buildroot}/usr/lib/%{name}/vendor/bin/ \
  --without test</pre></div>
</div>


<p>If we ran the rakefile using plain old <code>rake package</code>, it would create
our package with no issues. However, we want to use bundler to manage
all of our gems &mdash; build, test and production dependencies. We want to
use a bundler-provided rake, not a system-installed one. But if we ran
rake using <code>bundle exec rake package</code>, it would fail with the
following errors:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>$ bundle exec rake package
# ... lots of output ...
+ bundle install --path /home/ppotter/src/node-api/BUILDROOT/node-api-0.0.3-9001.x86_64/usr/lib/node-api/vendor/bundle/ --deployment --binstubs /home/ppotter/src/node-api/BUILDROOT/node-api-0.0.3-9001.x86_64/usr/lib/node-api/vendor/bin/ --without test
Could not find rake-0.9.2.2 in any of the sources
Run `bundle install` to install missing gems.</pre></div>
</div>


<p>This is confusing &mdash; <code>bundle install --deployment</code> shouldn&rsquo;t care
about the rake gem, because in our Gemfile we&rsquo;ve declared it in the
test group, which we are excluding using <code>--without
test</code>. Furthermore, the working directory for this command is
/home/ppotter/src/node-api/BUILD/node-api, which is different from the
directory where we are running <code>bundle exec rake package</code>, so any
/home/ppotter/src/node-api/.bundle/config file which the outer bundler
process has created should not conflict.</p>

<p>The error occurs because bundler achieves much of its magic by
setting various environment variables. To prevent the outer bundler
instance &mdash; the one that runs rake &mdash; from interfering with the inner
bundler instance &mdash; the one that installs our gems in deployment mode
to the BUILDROOT directory &mdash; we need to unset those environment
variables:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>env -u BUNDLE_GEMFILE -u BUNDLE_BIN_PATH -u RUBYOPT -u GEM_HOME -u GEM_PATH \
bundle install \
  --path %{buildroot}/usr/lib/%{name}/vendor/bundle/ \
  --deployment \
  --binstubs %{buildroot}/usr/lib/%{name}/vendor/bin/ \
  --without test</pre></div>
</div>


<h2>Modifying the .bundle/config file</h2>

<p>The .bundle/config file (which lives in the same place as the Gemfile)
contains configuration which tells bundler where it has installed its
gems. If we want to package our bundler-installed gems into an RPM, we
need to also package .bundle/config so that bundler will know where
the gems live on the target machine. Here is mine, after running the
above command:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>---
BUNDLE_WITHOUT: test
BUNDLE_FROZEN: &quot;1&quot;
BUNDLE_BIN: /home/ppotter/src/node-api/BUILDROOT/node-api-0.0.3-9001.x86_64/usr/lib/node-api/vendor/bin/
BUNDLE_PATH: /home/ppotter/src/node-api/BUILDROOT/node-api-0.0.3-9001.x86_64/usr/lib/node-api/vendor/bundle/
BUNDLE_DISABLE_SHARED_GEMS: &quot;1&quot;</pre></div>
</div>


<p>This is clearly going to cause problems if we package this file as-is,
because the gems are not going to live in these directories but
instead in /usr/lib/node-api/vendor/bundle. We need to strip the
leading BUILDROOT path from the directories in this file before we can
package it. We do this with a sed script in the %install section of
the RPM specfile:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>sed -i -e 's,%{buildroot},,' %{buildroot}/usr/lib/${name}/.bundle/config</pre></div>
</div>


<p>I&rsquo;m sure that this is not the &ldquo;bundler way&rdquo; of doing things, but as I
have said before, bundler and RPM&rsquo;s worldview are seemingly
irreconcilable and something like this is necessary to get them to
work together.</p>

<h2>Architecture-specific code</h2>

<p>The process of installing gems can also install system-specific
extensions which will not be as portable as pure ruby code, nor as
portable as the source .gem files from the vendor/cache
directory. This is another reason for recommending that you run
<code>bundle install --deployment</code> on the target machine rather than in the
build environment.</p>

<p>RPM, however, also has a way of coping with this portability problem,
by marking packages as architecture-specific. If you don&rsquo;t specify an
architecture yourself, rpmbuild will even autodetect any
system-specific binaries in your RPM and give it an appropriate
tag. We relied on this behaviour and sure enough, our resultant RPM is
considered x86_64 code rather than noarch. This is fine for our
production environment, where all machines run the same hardware and OS.</p>

<h2>Installing bundler itself</h2>

<p>We still need bundler to be present on the target machine. We used the
fantastic <a href="https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm">fpm</a> tool to create a
rubygem-bundler RPM, and made our node-api RPM depend on
rubygem-bundler.</p>

<p>We could have used fpm to package every single gem as a separate
RPM. We didn&rsquo;t go with this option, because it doesn&rsquo;t enable
separation of sets of gems used by different applications, and it
doesn&rsquo;t allow us to know exactly which gems will be used by a
particular source code version.</p>

<h2>Future possibilities</h2>

<p>Bundler 1.1 (which hasn&rsquo;t yet been released) provides a <code>--standalone</code>
option which allows you to install gems in such a way that they don&rsquo;t
depend on bundler. I&rsquo;d be very interested to investigate this option
for packaging ruby apps as RPMs, although since we were running our
ruby through Phusion Passenger I wonder whether it would work for us,
or if it only works for the bundler-created binstubs.</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>

<p>After all of this work, we have a solution which combines the
advantages of both RPM and bundler:</p>

<ul>
<li>Every file we create on the target machine belongs to an RPM, and
can be traced back to a particular Jenkins job which created that
RPM</li>
<li>The gems our application uses are isolated from any other gems on
the target machine</li>
<li>We can use bundler to handle transitive dependencies, while at the
same time locking in the versions of all gems for a particular
source code version. This means we have confidence that exactly the
same gems were used in testing on the CI server as are used in
production.</li>
</ul>
