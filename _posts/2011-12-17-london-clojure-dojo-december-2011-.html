<p><em>Apologies for lack of November post; I&rsquo;ve been somewhat snowed under
 recently. Normal service now resuming&hellip;</em></p>

<p>December&rsquo;s Clojure dojo focused on difficult problems from
<a href="http://www.4clojure.com/">4clojure</a>. I had dabbled with 4clojure
before on some of the easier problems, but I honestly hadn&rsquo;t
anticipated just how difficult the hard problems can get!</p>

<p>Our team decided to go in gently, going for medium-difficulty problems
rather than hard problems. This turned out to be one of our better
ideas of the evening, since we only managed to complete one and a half
medium problems in the time available!</p>

<h2>Juxtaposition</h2>

<p>The first problem we tackled was
<a href="http://www.4clojure.com/problem/59">Juxtaposition</a>, in which you have
to reimplement the <code>juxt</code> function. Our team took an approach where we
tried to develop solutions from first principles, rather than looking
up <code>(source juxt)</code>, so I think it might be enlightening to compare our
solutions with the <code>clojure.core</code> model answers. First, our solution:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>(<span class="keyword">defn</span> <span class="function">juxt</span> [&amp; fns]
        (<span class="keyword">fn</span> [&amp; args]
          (<span class="keyword">vec</span> (<span class="keyword">map</span> #(<span class="keyword">apply</span> % args) fns))))</pre></div>
</div>


<p>And the output of <code>(source juxt)</code> produces something like this:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>(<span class="keyword">defn</span> <span class="function">juxt</span> [&amp; fs]
     (<span class="keyword">fn</span> [&amp; args]
         (<span class="keyword">reduce</span> #(<span class="keyword">conj</span> %1 (<span class="keyword">apply</span> %2 args)) [] fs)))</pre></div>
</div>


<p>&hellip;except that the original source has special cases for small numbers
of arguments.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting the difference of approaches here. We both use the
form <code>(apply % args)</code> to apply the variable number of arguments to
each function in turn; however, we use <code>map</code> to do this, producing a
sequence, which we then must traverse in order to convert to a vector.</p>

<p>The <code>clojure.core</code> version, by contrast, starts with an empty vector
<code>[]</code>, and <code>conj</code>es each further result into the vector; in doing so,
it avoids traversing the list twice.</p>

<h2>Reductions</h2>

<p>The second problem we attempted was
<a href="http://www.4clojure.com/problem/60">Reductions</a>. Here&rsquo;s our attempt:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>(<span class="keyword">defn</span> <span class="function">my-red</span>
  ([f coll]
     (<span class="keyword">if</span> (<span class="keyword">seq</span> coll)
       (<span class="keyword">cons</span> (<span class="keyword">first</span> coll) (<span class="keyword">map</span> #(f % (<span class="keyword">first</span> coll)) (my-red f (<span class="keyword">rest</span> (<span class="keyword">seq</span> coll)))))
       []))
  ([f init coll]
     (my-red f (<span class="keyword">cons</span> init coll))))</pre></div>
</div>


<p>It performs well enough for bounded-length sequences:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>(my-red <span class="keyword">+</span> [<span class="integer">1</span> <span class="integer">2</span> <span class="integer">3</span> <span class="integer">4</span> <span class="integer">5</span>])
<span class="comment">;=&gt; (1 3 6 10 15)</span></pre></div>
</div>


<p>But it fails when it comes to infinite lazy sequences:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>(<span class="keyword">take</span> <span class="integer">5</span> (my-red <span class="keyword">+</span> (<span class="keyword">range</span>)))
<span class="comment">;=&gt; StackOverflowError</span></pre></div>
</div>


<p>We were very confused on the night as to why this should fail. Isn&rsquo;t
<code>map</code> lazy by default? Why, then, do we get a stack overflow?</p>

<p>The problem, which I have only found out today, 4 days after the
event, is that <code>map</code> is a function, and therefore its arguments are
evaluated before <code>map</code> itself is. Therefore, every call to <code>my-red</code>
necessarily makes a recursive call, and thus exhausts the stack. The
solution is to add a <code>lazy-seq</code> to the recursive call:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>(<span class="keyword">defn</span> <span class="function">my-red</span>
  ([f coll]
     (<span class="keyword">if</span> (<span class="keyword">seq</span> coll)
       (<span class="keyword">cons</span> (<span class="keyword">first</span> coll) (<span class="keyword">map</span> #(f % (<span class="keyword">first</span> coll)) (<span class="keyword">lazy-seq</span> (my-red f (<span class="keyword">rest</span> (<span class="keyword">seq</span> coll))))))
       []))
  ([f init coll]
     (my-red f (<span class="keyword">cons</span> init coll))))</pre></div>
</div>


<p>And thus, the previous example now works fine:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>(<span class="keyword">take</span> <span class="integer">5</span> (my-red <span class="keyword">+</span> (<span class="keyword">range</span>)))
<span class="comment">;=&gt; (0 1 3 6 10)</span></pre></div>
</div>


<p>It still doesn&rsquo;t pass all of the 4clojure unit tests, though. Work for
another time, perhaps.</p>

<p>The <code>clojure.core/reductions</code> source looks like this:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>(<span class="keyword">defn</span> <span class="function">reductions</span>
  <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">Returns a lazy seq of the intermediate values of the reduction (as
  per reduce) of coll by f, starting with init.</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>
  {<span class="symbol">:added</span> <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">1.2</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>}
  ([f coll]
     (<span class="keyword">lazy-seq</span>
      (<span class="keyword">if-let</span> [s (<span class="keyword">seq</span> coll)]
        (reductions f (<span class="keyword">first</span> s) (<span class="keyword">rest</span> s))
        (<span class="keyword">list</span> (f)))))
  ([f init coll]
     (<span class="keyword">cons</span> init
           (<span class="keyword">lazy-seq</span>
            (<span class="keyword">when-let</span> [s (<span class="keyword">seq</span> coll)]
              (reductions f (f init (<span class="keyword">first</span> s)) (<span class="keyword">rest</span> s)))))))</pre></div>
</div>


<p>It&rsquo;s a very similar approach to the problem, with some important
differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>It actually works (!)</li>
<li>It uses <code>if-let</code> and <code>when-let</code> with the <code>seq</code> function, relying on
the behaviour that for empty sequences, <code>seq</code> returns nil, but also
binding the returned seq simultaneously.</li>
<li>It treats the <code>[f init coll]</code> version as the primitive form and
expresses <code>[f coll]</code> in terms of <code>[f init coll]</code>. We do it the other
way, purely because we implemented <code>[f coll]</code> first. It&rsquo;s ugly,
though, particularly in cases where <code>init</code> is not the same type as
members of <code>coll</code>.</li>
<li>It has special case handling for the <code>(reductions f [])</code> case &mdash;
where an empty sequence is provided, it returns <code>(list (f))</code>.</li>
<li>I believe our use of <code>map</code> makes our solution quadratic rather than
linear in the length of the input sequence, because the item in the
nth position must be transformed by (n-1) fns and we don&rsquo;t reuse the
intermediate results like the clojure.core version does.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This has made me want to go back and give 4clojure a closer look. I
had tried the first few problems, which seemed trivially easy, but now
that I&rsquo;ve seen that even the &ldquo;Medium&rdquo; problems present a significant
challenge and raise all sorts of issues around laziness, algorithmic
complexity, and efficiency, I can see I&rsquo;ve a lot to learn from
4clojure.</p>

<p><em>The London clojure dojo happens on the last Tuesday of every month. During the dojo, we split into groups of four or five around a single computer, and each person takes a turn at the keyboard. This ensures that even if you have zero clojure experience, you will get the opportunity to write some code at the event.</em></p>

<p><em>Entry to the dojo is free, but advance booking is required. Listen for announcements on the London clojurians mailing list.</em></p>
